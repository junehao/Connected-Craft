## Connected Craft and Object Society

* A __craft__ is a cultural entity, a man-made object, and a functional work of art.
* A __smart craft__ is a man-made object that can sense and react with certain intelligence.
* The __connected craft__ is smart crafts that can communicate to each other.
* An __object society__ is a society of connected crafts.
* Just like human society, an object society is a complex network full of various communications and activities.
* To imagine the object society, use [anthropomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism) or personification.
* Need more inspirations about the object society? Watch [Wall-E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WALL-E), [Toy Story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_Story), [Beauty and the Beast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast_\(1991_film\)), and [Night at the Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_at_the_Museum).
